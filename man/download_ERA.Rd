\arguments{
\item{Variable}{ERA5(Land)-contained climate variable. See 'download' output of Variable_List() for possible values.}

\item{PrecipFix}{Logical. Era5(-land) total precipitation is recorded in cumulative steps per hour from the 00:00 time mark per day. Setting PrecipFix to TRUE converts these into records which represent the total precipitation per hour. Monthly records in Era5(-land) express the average daily total precipitation. Setting this argument to TRUE multiplies monthly records by the number of days per the respective month(s) to get to total precipitation records instead of average.  Default is FALSE.}

\item{Type}{Whether to download reanalysis ('reanalysis', 'monthly_averaged_reanalysis_by_hour_of_day') or ensemble ('ensemble_members', 'ensemble_mean', or 'ensemble_spread') data. Only available for era5 data.}

\item{DataSet}{Which ERA5 data set to download data from. 'era5' or 'era5-land'.}

\item{DateStart}{Date ('YYYY-MM-DD') at which to start time series of downloaded data.}

\item{DateStop}{Date ('YYYY-MM-DD') at which to stop time series of downloaded data.}

\item{TResolution}{Temporal resolution of final product. 'hour', 'day', 'month', or 'year'.}

\item{TStep}{Which time steps (numeric) to consider for temporal resolution. For example, specify bi-monthly data records by setting TResolution to 'month' and TStep to 2.}

\item{FUN}{A raster calculation argument as passed to `raster::stackApply()`. This controls what kind of data to obtain for temporal aggregates of reanalysis data. Specify 'mean' (default) for mean values, 'min' for minimum values, and 'max' for maximum values, among others.}

\item{Extent}{Optional, download data according to rectangular bounding box. specify as extent() object or as a raster, a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object, or a data.frame opbject. If Extent is a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame, this will be treated as a shapefile and the output will be cropped and masked to this shapefile. If Extent is a data.frame of geo-referenced point records, it needs to contain Lat and Lon columns as well as a non-repeating ID-column.}

\item{Buffer}{Optional. Identifies how big a rectangular buffer to draw around points if Extent is a data frame of points. Buffer is expressed as centessimal degrees.}

\item{ID}{Optional. Identifies which column in Extent to use for creation of individual buffers if Extent is a data.frame.}

\item{Dir}{Directory specifying where to download data to.}

\item{FileName}{A file name for the netcdf produced. Default is a combination parameters in the function call.}

\item{API_User}{Character; ECMWF cds user number.}

\item{API_Key}{Character; ECMWF cds API key.}

\item{TryDown}{Optional, numeric. How often to attempt the download of each individual file that the function queries from the server. This is to circumvent having to restart the entire function when encountering connectivity issues.}

\item{verbose}{Optional, logical. Whether to report progress of the function in the console or not.}

\item{Cores}{Numeric. How many cores to use.^This can speed up downloads of long time-series. If you want output to your console during the process, use Cores = 1. Parallel processing is carried out when Cores is bigger than 1. Default is 1.}

\item{TimeOut}{Numeric. The timeout for each download in seconds. Default 36000 seconds (10 hours).}
}
\value{
A raster object containing the downloaded ERA5(-Land) data, and a NETCDF (.nc) file in the specified directory.
}
\description{
This function breaks down download calls into monthly intervals, downloads ERA5(-Land) data from ECMWF servers according to user-specification, and fuses the downloaded files together according to user-demands. The actual time to download is dependent on ECMWF download queues. Users need an API key (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to) to be set up.
